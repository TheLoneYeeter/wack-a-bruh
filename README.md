# wack-a-bruh
### Wack-a-mole but with bruh buttons.

I'm only adding this here so I can use it in repl.it. 
I am also using this to find my way around GitHub and git in general.

#### Features I may add:

* Random 50/50 guess buttons, game over if wrong one chosen
  * Game over screen for this
* Stopwatch

Both of these are unlikely to happen, if at all.

The above line is correct, I do not know how to do this.
