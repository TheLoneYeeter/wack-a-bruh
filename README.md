# wack-a-bruh
## Wack-a-mole but with bruh buttons.

I'm only adding this here so I can use it in repl.it. 
I am also using this to find my way around GitHub and git in general.
This branch (plan_basic) is an slightly older version that is fully functional, since I am working on the 50/50 guess on main, which probably isn't the best choice, but it doesn't really matter.

#### Features I may add:

* Random 50/50 guess buttons, game over if wrong one chosen
  * Game over screen for this
* Stopwatch

Both of these are unlikely to happen, if at all.
